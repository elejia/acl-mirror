**************************
Was hoping it wasn't denying access for mirrors from github 
but that's my guess and that's fair. Lots of bandwidth if
people abuse it :(

Would be cool if the gnu folks would consider a github
mirror since github is pretty industry standard, even if
it goes against their philosophy. To each their own.
